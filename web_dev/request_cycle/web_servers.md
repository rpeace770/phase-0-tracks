- Small is beautiful. Small programs are easy to use, easy to maintain, and consume fewer resources.
- Linux chooses portability over efficiency which means that the programs can run on multiple systems instead of having to build and test new programs for each system.
- Use software leverage which means using code from other programmers to build your own programs.
- Store data as text. It can be easily read and edited and it's a common format between systems.

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
- A VPS is virtual memory that can process requests made by the browser and send/receive information. You can use these virtual servers to run your own website/programs. One advantage of using a VPS is that you can choose the size of the server for your own personal needs. Another advantage is that you get root access and can completely control the server. Private servers may perform better because it is not a shared server.

### Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
