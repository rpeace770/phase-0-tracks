###Plan
1. Use console and dev tools to test each time I try a new concept
2. Use Stack Overflow, Codecademy, jQuery textbook, W3 schools, jQuery documentation for research
3. Breaks are important, user pomodoro technique
4. Pick one concept to work on, work for 20 minutes, move on and come back if confused
5. Take notes on what I've learned
6. Brainstorm project ideas along the way
