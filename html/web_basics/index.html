	<h1>All About Rocko</h1>
	<p>I want to introduce my cat, Rocko.</p>
	<img src="rocko/derp3.jpg" alt="Rocko derp face">
	<p>I adopted Rocko two years ago in Austin. He was four years old, so they put him in the senior "<em>apartment</em>". There were two older lady cats and he was hiding under a small, white table. The employee told me that the older women were beating up on Rocko. I reached under the table to pet him and he gently bit my finger. I knew he was saying, "Take me home."</p>

	<p>Now, he no longer hides. He is happy and comfortable in his new home. His hobbies include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Napping</li>
		<li>Watching the birds</li>
		<li>Chasing yarn or feather toys</li>
		<li>Snugglin'</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are hobbies for most cats, so let me tell you three things that set him apart from other cats.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Without fail, he gets up from napping at 5pm to find me wherever I am. He sits directly in front of me and stares until I get up to feed him. He doesn't meow or paw at me, he just stares.</li>
		<br>
		<li>He has the <strong>most</strong> amazing derp face. Example below:</li>

		<li>He likes to do yoga.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I never would have found my best friend if it hadn't been for Austin Pets Alive! I'm a believer in the "Adopt, Don't Shop" mentality, if at all possible. Check out their website <a href="https://www.austinpetsalive.org/">here</a> if you are looking for a new friend!</p>
