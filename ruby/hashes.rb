# clients name, age, number of children, decor theme, etc
# need strings, integers, and boolean data
# keys should be symbols UNLESS a string is needed

#prompt user for all information

#convert user input to appropriate data type

#print hash to screen when all questions are answered

#give user opportunity to update a key, no loop, once is fine
#if designer says none, skip the update

#use string method to turn into a symbol

#no need for user errors

#print latest hash and exit
