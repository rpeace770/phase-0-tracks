# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version Control is the process of updating files and saving those updates frequently. This makes sure you can go back and find specific updates to see if there is a bug. It's also useful when you can have a team working on a project together. Version control helps keep the master branch in perfect condition while each member works on improving different sections.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master folder where you can make edits and improvements to test before changing the master folder. You would use a new branch to test any new features before adding it to the master branch. This makes sure that every update is working before other people use it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you save an update made to a file. This also makes a save point in GitHub and you can find these changes for future use. A good commit message is detailed and explains any changes made to the file.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when two branches do not merge completely. This is due to conflicting code that will not run successfully together.
