# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Took out this section.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master folder where you can make edits and improvements to test before changing the master folder. You would use a new branch to test any new features before adding it to the master branch. This makes sure that every update is working before other people use it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you save an update made to a file. This also makes a save point in GitHub and you can find these changes for future use. A good commit message is detailed and explains any changes made to the file.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when two branches do not merge completely. This is due to conflicting code that will not run successfully together.
