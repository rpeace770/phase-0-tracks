<!--  The purpose of HTML semantic tags is to give meaning to each section in a webpage. It also helps with any users who have disabilities. The most useful tags to me are the header, footer, nav, main, and section tags. These are sections that you usually see on every webpage and are familiar to most users. 
The browser displays elements in the order they are written in HTML from top to bottom and left to right.
I learned how to make snippets which makes programming easier and quicker. I will absolutely be creating snippets when I start coding with new langauges or when I find myself typing the same code over and over again.
The concept that was the most challenging was visualizing the layout of the page using semantic elements. Using divs makes more sense visually to me because they can be anywhere, so I just need more practice using the semantic elements. I will be looking at example websites that use semantic elements and practicing these elements whenever I have a free moment. -->
